üìå HOW TO MAKE MASTER THE DEFAULT BRANCH ON GITHUB
================================================================================

Current situation:
‚úì Master branch has all notification generator code
‚úì Master is ahead of yishutest by 2 commits
‚úó GitHub still shows yishutest as default

Follow these steps to fix:

================================================================================
STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================

1. Open your web browser and go to:
   https://github.com/YishuGudd/in-hackathon2025-ai-agent-genai-notification

2. Click "Settings" tab
   (It's in the top navigation, to the right of "Insights")

3. In the left sidebar, click "General"
   (Should already be selected by default)

4. Scroll down to find "Default branch" section
   (It's near the top of the page)

5. You'll see something like:
   "The default branch is yishutest"
   
6. Click the switch icon (‚áÑ) or pencil icon (‚úèÔ∏è) next to "yishutest"

7. A dropdown will appear - select "master"

8. Click "Update" button

9. Confirm by clicking "I understand, update the default branch"

10. Done! ‚úÖ

================================================================================
VERIFY IT WORKED
================================================================================

After changing:

1. Go back to your repository homepage:
   https://github.com/YishuGudd/in-hackathon2025-ai-agent-genai-notification

2. You should see "master" shown as the branch (not "yishutest")

3. The branch dropdown should show "master" by default

================================================================================
THEN SHARE WITH YOUR TEAM
================================================================================

Once master is the default, share this link:

https://github.com/YishuGudd/in-hackathon2025-ai-agent-genai-notification

Your teammates will automatically get the master branch when they clone!

git clone https://github.com/YishuGudd/in-hackathon2025-ai-agent-genai-notification.git
cd in-hackathon2025-ai-agent-genai-notification
# Automatically on master branch!

================================================================================
OPTIONAL: CLEAN UP OLD BRANCHES
================================================================================

After master is the default, you can delete the old branches:

# Delete yishutest (locally and remotely)
git push origin --delete yishutest
git branch -d yishutest

# Delete main (locally and remotely)
git push origin --delete main
git branch -d main

This keeps your repository clean with just the master branch.
