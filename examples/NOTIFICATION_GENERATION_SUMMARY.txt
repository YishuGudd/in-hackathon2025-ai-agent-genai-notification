BRAND VOICE TRANSFORMATIONS
================================================================================

OLD STYLE                          NEW DOORDASH VOICE
---------------------------------  ------------------------------------
"Fresh noodles nearby"             "Noodle cravings covered"
"Chinese favorites calling"        "Skip the schlep"
"Build your own bowl"              "You pick. We roll"
"Your favorites are back"          "Your go-tos are here"
"Save on your next order"          "Deal dropped. You're up"
"Fresh bowls and salads"           "Bowls and salads nearby"
