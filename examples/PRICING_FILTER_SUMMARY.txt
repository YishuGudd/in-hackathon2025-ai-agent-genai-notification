PRICING FILTER INTEGRATION - VERSION 1.2
================================================================================
Date: October 16, 2025
New Feature: Price sensitivity-based notification boosting

================================================================================
WHAT'S NEW
================================================================================

PRICING INTELLIGENCE 💰
• Extracts promo usage % from consumer profiles
• Identifies value-conscious consumers (promo usage > 25% OR "value seeker" label)
• Boosts deal notification scores for price-sensitive consumers
• Ensures deal notifications appear in top 10 for the right audience

================================================================================
HOW IT WORKS
================================================================================

1. EXTRACT PRICE SENSITIVITY
   From profile: "Balanced Spender... with 26.45% promo usage"
   Extract: 26.45% promo usage

2. CLASSIFY CONSUMER
   • Promo usage > 25%? → Value-conscious
   • Contains "value seeker"? → Value-conscious  
   • Contains "budget"? → Value-conscious
   • Otherwise → Balanced spender

3. ADJUST NOTIFICATION SCORES
   
   VALUE-CONSCIOUS CONSUMERS:
   • "Deal dropped. You're up" → Score 95 (BOOSTED from 78)
   • "$0 delivery fee" → Score 93 (BOOSTED from 78)
   • Deal notifications appear in top 3-4 rankings
   
   BALANCED SPENDERS:
   • "Deal dropped. You're up" → Score 78 (filtered out)
   • Deal notifications not included (below 80 threshold)
   • Focus on cuisine/food preferences instead
